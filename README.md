# ai-virtual-assistant
PROJECT on asst
The code uses various Python libraries, such as pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for speech-to-text, smtplib and email.message for email functionality, pyautogui for automation, webbrowser for opening web pages, wikipedia for Wikipedia search, pywhatkit for YouTube search, and requests and newsapi for weather and news retrieval.

The main function of the code is to provide a voice-controlled personal assistant that can perform various tasks based on the user's input. The code listens for voice commands, processes them, and responds accordingly.
